           <img src = "/home/odinstudent/repos/odin-recipes/new orleans gumbo.jpeg" alt = "new orleans gumbo">
             <p>New Orleans-style gumbo is a true taste of Southern tradition. 
                This boldly flavored stew is bursting with fresh, filling ingredients like bell pepper,
                 sausage, stewed tomatoes, and crabmeat. Hot sauce ad Cajun seasonings 
                 add a kick that makes this Lousiana dish a favorite amongst our 
                 community of home cooks.</p>
           <h2>What is Gumbo?</h2>
           <p>Gumbo is one of the most famous dishes to result from Louisiana's shared Creole-Cajun
             heritage. Gumbo falls somewhere between a thick stew and a 
             hearty soup and can contain ingredients such as chicken, 
             sausage, ham, seafood, okra, tomatoes, and greens.</p>

             <h2>How to make Gumbo?</h2>
             <p>Boldly delicious New Orleans-style gumbo is surprisingly 
                easy to make at home. You'll find the full recipe below with 
                step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when 
                you make this top-rated recipe:<br><br>

                Great gumbo starts with roux, a flavorful thickening agent 
                made from equal parts fat and flour. Once the roux is a deep 
                golden color, add diced veggies and sausage to the mix. Then, 
                incorporate beef bouillon, hot sauce, tomatoes, and seasonings 
                to intensify the flavor.<br><br>

                Let the gumbo simmer for 45 minutes before adding file powder, 
                okra, and seafood. The result will be a lusciously hearty stew 
                packed with Creole spice.

                <li>2 tablespoons bacon drippings</li>
                <li>2 (10 ounce) packages frozen cut okra, thawed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
                <li>1 pound lump crabmeat</li>

            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Make the roux:<br>
                    Whisk together flour and 3/4 cup bacon drippings in a large, 
                    heavy saucepan over medium-low heat until smooth. Cook roux, 
                    whisking constantly, until it turns a rich mahogany brown 
                    color. This can take 20 to 30 minutes; watch heat carefully 
                    and whisk constantly or roux will burn. Remove from heat; 
                    continue whisking until mixture stops cooking. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Make the gumbo:<br>
                    Place celery, onion, green bell pepper, and garlic into the work 
                    bowl of a food processor, and pulse until all vegetables are 
                    very finely chopped. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Stir vegetables into the roux, and mix in sausage. 
                    Bring mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat, and cook 
                    until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from
                     heat and set aside.</li>
                     <br>
                 <li>Combine water and beef bouillon cubes in a large Dutch oven or 
                    soup pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir until 
                    bouillon cubes dissolve, then whisk roux mixture into the
                     boiling water.</li>
                     <br>
                <li>Reduce heat to a simmer and mix in sugar, salt, hot pepper 
                    sauce, Cajun seasoning, bay leaves, thyme, stewed tomatoes, 
                    and tomato sauce. Simmer soup over low heat for 1 hour;
                    mix in 2 teaspoons of file gumbo powder at the 45-minute mark. </li>
                    <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons bacon drippings in a skillet over 
                    medium heat. Add okra and vinegar and cook for 15 minutes; 
                    remove okra with a slotted spoon, and stir into the simmering 
                    gumbo.</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Mix in reserved vegetables, crabmeat, shrimp, and Worcestershire 
                    sauce, and simmer until flavors have blended, 45 more minutes. 
                    Stir in 2 more teaspoons of file gumbo powder just before serving. </li>
